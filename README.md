## ***Needs to be updated***


# Study-Set-App
Basic study set app. Hold onto a flashcard to delete it.

# What I Learned
- Passing information from TextInputLayout from one activity to another.
- Passing information from one activity to another using Intent and Bundle.
- Use of AlertDialog to implement a delete feature to delete a flashcard.

# More To Come
I will implement new features in the future. Some include selecting multiple flashcards to delete at once, as well as adding several flashcards at once. I will eventually re-do the desing and how the app looks overall.
